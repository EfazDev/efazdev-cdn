In order to generate an approved user info JSON, you will need Python. And simply add an item with the user id as the key and `{}` as the value. Example: <br>
`"1078332491": {},`

If you want to add a color to one user, add the key `hexColor` and value it to a hex value like `#ff0000` for red. Example: <br>
`"hexColor": "#ff0000",`
