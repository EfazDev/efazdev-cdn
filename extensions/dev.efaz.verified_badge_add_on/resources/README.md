# Efaz's Verified Badge Add-on Approved Users
Hello! It seems like you want to select the users you want to verify on your side. Well, this guide will help with that!

## 1. File Preparation
Before we get started, we will need download some files. Firstly, download the [make_approved.py](https://github.com/EfazDev/efazdev-cdn/blob/main/extensions/dev.efaz.verified_badge_add_on/resources/make_approved.py) file from GitHub by going to each file link and downloading them raw. Next, you will need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to fully build your JSON.

## 2. Preparing your JSON
Alright, now, we will get started with making the JSON. First, get the User IDs of the users you want to add (this can be found in their profile links such as `1078332491` in https://www.roblox.com/users/1078332491/profile). Once prepared with a list, we will now launch a Python script to start making. Launch Command Prompt (for Windows) or Terminal (for macOS) and type `py` for Windows or `python3` for macOS followed by a space. Next, drag the [make_approved.py](https://github.com/EfazDev/efazdev-cdn/blob/main/extensions/dev.efaz.verified_badge_add_on/resources/make_approved.py) file into the window and this should be similarly like `python3 /........./make_approved.py` or `py C:\........\make_approved.py`. Whatever it is, just make sure make_approved.py is in the end. Anyway, now click enter and then type 1 and hit enter to enter your User IDs and save your file.

## 3. Done!
You have successfully created your Approved Users JSON file! Now, if you want to refresh the list, not recreate it all again and not rather editing the script manually, use the [regenerate_user_infos.py](https://github.com/EfazDev/efazdev-cdn/blob/main/extensions/dev.efaz.verified_badge_add_on/resources/regenerate_user_infos.py) file to regenerate the list with newer information!
