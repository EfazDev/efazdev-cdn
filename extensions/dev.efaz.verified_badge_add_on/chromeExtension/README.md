It may be depending on your OS to extract the ZIP file. For macOS, it would just be to open it using Archive Utility. For Windows, it may be to open the file and go open the main folder inside, then, just click the Extract All and select to a folder.
### 3. Setting up with Chrome
To set up with Chrome, go to chrome://extensions and enable Developer Mode on the top right. It's important for this installation. Next, you will see more buttons on the top left [Load unpacked, Pack extension and Update]. Click on the Load unpacked, select the folder you exported the Beta on and then continue! After that, the extension is installed and you're all done!
### 3.1. Setting up with other browsers
There was may be issues with other browsers that don't support the Chrome Extension API. So far, I only know the instructions for installing onto Chrome. So, you may need to figure out a YouTube tutorial on your specific browser. Please know that Firefox may also cause lots of issues due to most of its extensions using Manifest v2.
### 4. Expiration
After a certain amount of time, Chrome may remove the extension from the system so you may have to redo Step 3 again.
